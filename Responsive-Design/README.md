## Introduction to Responsive Design

Responsive design is a design approach that ensures web pages adapt to different screen sizes and device capabilities. With the growing diversity of devices, from smartphones and tablets to laptops and desktops, responsive design has become a crucial aspect of modern web development.

## Media Queries

### What Are Media Queries?

Media queries are a CSS feature that allows you to apply styles based on the characteristics of the device, such as its screen width, height, resolution, and orientation. They are a fundamental tool in creating responsive designs.

### How to Use Media Queries

Media queries can be added directly in your CSS file or within a `<style>` tag in your HTML. The basic syntax of a media query is as follows:

```css
@media (condition) {
    /* CSS rules go here */
}
```

For example, to apply styles only to screens wider than 768px, you can use the following media query:

```css
@media (min-width: 768px) {
    body {
        background-color: lightblue;
    }
}
```

### Common Media Query Breakpoints

Breakpoints are the points at which your web page's layout will change based on the screen size. Here are some common breakpoints used in responsive design:

- Extra small devices (phones, less than 576px)
- Small devices (tablets, 576px and up)
- Medium devices (desktops, 768px and up)
- Large devices (desktops, 992px and up)
- Extra large devices (large desktops, 1200px and up)

Example of media queries for these breakpoints:

```css
/* Extra small devices (phones, less than 576px) */
@media (max-width: 575.98px) {
    /* CSS rules */
}

/* Small devices (tablets, 576px and up) */
@media (min-width: 576px) and (max-width: 767.98px) {
    /* CSS rules */
}

/* Medium devices (desktops, 768px and up) */
@media (min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 991.98px) {
    /* CSS rules */
}

/* Large devices (desktops, 992px and up) */
@media (min-width: 992px) and (max-width: 1199.98px) {
    /* CSS rules */
}

/* Extra large devices (large desktops, 1200px and up) */
@media (min-width: 1200px) {
    /* CSS rules */
}
```

## Responsive Design Principles

### Fluid Grids

A fluid grid layout uses relative units like percentages instead of fixed units like pixels. This allows elements to resize proportionally to the screen size.

Example:

```css
.container {
    width: 100%;
    padding: 0 15px;
    margin: 0 auto;
}

.column {
    float: left;
    width: 50%;
}

@media (max-width: 768px) {
    .column {
        width: 100%;
    }
}
```

### Flexible Images

Flexible images are images that resize within the constraints of their container, preventing them from breaking the layout.

Example:

```css
img {
    max-width: 100%;
    height: auto;
}
```

### Viewport Meta Tag

The viewport meta tag ensures that the web page scales correctly on different devices.

Example:

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
```

### Mobile-First Design

Mobile-first design is an approach where you design for the smallest screen sizes first and then progressively enhance the design for larger screens.

Example:

```css
/* Mobile styles */
body {
    font-size: 16px;
}

/* Tablet styles */
@media (min-width: 768px) {
    body {
        font-size: 18px;
    }
}

/* Desktop styles */
@media (min-width: 992px) {
    body {
        font-size: 20px;
    }
}
```

## Examples and Exercises

### Example 1: Simple Responsive Layout

Create a simple responsive layout with two columns that stack on smaller screens.

HTML:

```html
<div class="container">
    <div class="column">Column 1</div>
    <div class="column">Column 2</div>
</div>
```

CSS:

```css
.container {
    width: 100%;
    padding: 0 15px;
    margin: 0 auto;
}

.column {
    float: left;
    width: 50%;
}

@media (max-width: 768px) {
    .column {
        width: 100%;
    }
}
```

### Exercise 1: Responsive Navigation Menu

Create a responsive navigation menu that turns into a hamburger menu on smaller screens.
